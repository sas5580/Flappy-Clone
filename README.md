# Flappy-Clone

### Try it out [here.](http://sas5580.github.io/Flappy-Clone/)

This is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird mobile game that I coded myself. 
A feature that I added to the classic game is a slider before starting the game that allows control over the size of the gap between the pieps to test one's skill further.
